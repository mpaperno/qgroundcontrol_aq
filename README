BUILDING FROM SOURCE
====================

Linux 
=====


To build on Ubuntu Linux (others are similar but might use different installer and package names; you may also need to build the Qt 4.8.4 libraries from source):

sudo apt-get install phonon libqt4-dev \
 libphonon-dev libphonon4 phonon-backend-gstreamer \
 qtcreator libsdl1.2-dev libflite1 flite1-dev build-essential \
 libopenscenegraph-dev

cd directory

git clone https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol.git

go to libs/thirdParty -> libxbee 

Create Library -> Readme file in folder

Ubuntu Application Menu -> Development -> Qt Creator

QtCreator Menu File -> Open File or Project..

Open directory/qgroundcontrol/qgroundcontrol.pro

Hit the green play button to compile and launch it

Done.


Windows
=======

GNU GCC / MINGW IS UNTESTED, COULD WORK
USE QT CREATOR OR VISUAL STUDIO 2008 / 2010 EXPRESS EDITION, BOTH FREE!

Windows XP/7:

Prerequsites:

1) Download and install the Qt 4.8.4 (not 5.x) libraries for Windows from http://qt-project.org/downloads (the Visual Studio 2010 version).

2) For voice support, first follow the instructions in libs/QtSpeech/INSTALL.txt.

3) If you do not have Visual Studio PRO version installed, you also need the ATL MFC developer package.  The simplest way to get this is to download the Windows Driver Kit Version 7.1.0 (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800).  Mount the ISO and run the installer, then select the Development package.  Install it to the folder of your choice (you can remove it later).  Once installed, find the inc/atl71 folder and copy the contents to \Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\atlmfc.  Then find the lib/ATL/i386 folder and copy the contents to \Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib.


Option 1: Qt Creator with Microsoft Windows SDK

4) Download Qt Creator 2.x, also from http://qt-project.org/downloads .

5) Download and install the Windows 7.1 SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279) (Win 8 SDK might possibly work as well).

6) Go to the QGroundControl folder and then to thirdParty/libxbee and build it following the instructions in win32.README

7) Run Qt Creator and open the qgroundcontrol.pro file from this project.  Adjust the build directories on the opening screen.

8) Click the Project button on the left and configure your build settings as appropriate.  You may need to edit the Qt Kits if your Qt 4.8.4 installation is not detected automatically.

9) Compile in Qt Cretor using the Build button or CTRL-B


Option 2: Visual Studio 2008/2010

4) Download and install Visual Studio 2008 or 2010 Express Edition (free) from https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio. If using Visual Studio 2010, make sure you are running at least SP1. There is a linking error you'll encounter otherwise that will prevent compilation.

5) Go to the QGroundControl folder and then to thirdParty/libxbee and build it following the instructions in win32.README

6) Open the Qt Command Prompt program (should be in the Start Menu), navigate to the source folder of QGroundControl and create the Visual Studio project by typing:

`qmake -tp vc qgroundcontrol.pro`

7) Now start Visual Studio and load the qgroundcontrol.vcproj if using Visual Studio 2008 or qgroundcontrol.vcxproj if using Visual Studio 2010

8) Compile and edit in Visual Studio. If you need to add new files, add them to qgroundcontrol.pro and re-run `qmake -tp vc qgroundcontrol.pro



Mac OS X (incomplete)
========

To build on Mac OS X (10.6 or later):

Install SDL
-----------
1) Download SDL from:  <http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.14.dmg>

2) From the SDL disk image, copy the `sdl.framework` bundle to `/Library/Frameworks` directory (if you are not an admin copy to `~/Library/Framewroks`)

Install QT
-----------
1) Download Qt 4.8.4 (not 5.x)

2) Double click the package installer

Build QGroundControl
--------------------
1) From the terminal go to the `groundcontrol` directory

2) Run `qmake`

3) Run `make -j8`
